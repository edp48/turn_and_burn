This folder contains all the files needed to reproduce the Data Presented in my Paper "Optimal Cislunar Trajectories with Continuous, High-Thrust Nuclear-Thermal Propulsion" Presented at SciTech in January of 2025. The contents of the folder are as follows:

Scitech_presentation2025.pdf: A pdf copy of the Presentation $\sigma$

Exhaust_Prop: A Folder that contains the .mat and .m files needed to create all the figures associated with the case study that exhausted all of the spacecraft's propellant.

Fixed_Eccent: A Folder that contains the .mat and .m files needed to create all the figures associated with the case study that halts numerical integration when a threshold on eccentricity is reached.

Other_Plots: A Folder that contains scripts to create the rest of the plots in the paper/presentation. 



NOTES: You must have NAIF's Spice package for MATLAB MICE installed for this to work. The startup.m script in the parent folder helps get the appropriate paths established. This Code was written and tested in MATLAB 2024a and is not guaranteed to work on other versions.
